                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Privacy is given utmost importance. The policy of the Piñata bot is to respect privacy regarding any information that may be collected through the bot, Piñata, which is provided as a Discord application.</p>

                <h2>Information Collected</h2>
                <p>The following types of information are collected to provide better services to all users:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Discord user ID and display name when you interact with the bot.</li>
                    <li>Information on user interactions and matches made by the bot for functionality purposes.</li>
                    <li>Data from guilds (servers) including guild IDs, names, owner IDs, and member counts.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How Information is Used</h2>
                <h3>Purpose of Data Collection</h3>
                <p>Data collected by Piñata Bot is strictly used for facilitating the matchmaking service. This includes making matches between users and ensuring that duplicate pairings do not occur. The integrity and purposefulness of the service are prioritized, and it is ensured that data is used solely to enhance the user experience within the guild.</p>
                <h3>Prohibition of Data Misuse</h3>
                <p>It is ensured that under no circumstances will the collected data be used for any purposes other than those stated above. The trust of users is maintained by ensuring that their data is not manipulated, mishandled, or exploited for any unrelated activities.</p>
                <h3>Data Security and Third-Party Sharing</h3>
                <p>Data security is paramount. To this end, all data remains exclusively within the confines of the server and is never exported, sold, or distributed to third parties. Strict data protection standards are upheld to prevent unauthorized access or sharing, thereby safeguarding user privacy and maintaining data integrity.</p>

                <h2>Data Management</h2>
                <h3>Data Storage and Security</h3>
                <p>All personal data collected by the Piñata bot is stored securely in AWS data centers located in Ireland, and reasonable measures are taken to protect the information from unauthorized access or disclosure. As such, European data protection regulations are applied, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A commitment is made to ensure the security and protection of the personal information that is processed, and to provide a compliant and consistent approach to data protection.</p>
                <h3>Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
                <p>Data related to user interactions and matchmaking outcomes are retained while Piñata Bot is active within a guild (a Discord server). This data facilitates the ongoing functionality of the matchmaking service and enhances user experience by preserving the history of interactions.</p>
                <p>Guild administrators are granted the authority to delete the entire history of matchmaking records at any time using the /reset command. This action is irreversible and ensures that control over the data within their guild is maintained.</p>
                <p>In the event that Piñata Bot is removed from a guild, all retained data specific to that guild—including previous matchmaking records—are stored securely for a period of 24 hours (1 day). This retention period allows for the possibility of data recovery in the case of accidental bot removal. Following the conclusion of the 24-hour period after Piñata Bot's departure from a guild, all related data will be permanently deleted from the database. This measure is in place to ensure user privacy and data protection, with a commitment to user data security and compliance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

                <h2>Your Data Rights</h2>
                <p>Requests can be made for a copy of your data, to rectify any data, or to request the deletion of your data. Please contact using the provided methods for such requests.</p>
                <p>For any inquiries about data protection practices or data privacy rights under GDPR, please contact using the provided methods.</p>

                <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
                <p>The Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.</p>
