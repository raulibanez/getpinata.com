                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>YYour privacy is important. The Piñata bot's policy is to respect your privacy regarding any information that may be collected through the bot, Piñata, which is provided as a Discord application.</p>

                <h2>Information Collected</h2>
                <p>The following types of information is collected to provide better services to all users:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Discord user ID and display name when you interact with the bot.</li>
                    <li>Information on user interactions and matches made by the bot for functionality purposes.</li>
                    <li>Data from guilds (servers) including guild IDs, names, owner IDs, and member counts.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Data Management and Protection</h2>
                <p>All personal data collected by the Piñata bot is stored securely in AWS data centers located in Ireland. As such, European data protection regulations apply, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). There is a commitment to ensuring the security and protection of the personal information that is processed, and to provide a compliant and consistent approach to data protection.
                </p>
                <p>If you have any questions about our data protection practices or your data privacy rights under GDPR, please contact using the links below.</p>


                <h2>How Information is Used</h2>
                <p>The information collected is used to operate the bot and provide its features, such as matching users and managing interactions within the Discord servers.</p>

                <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
                <p>All data is stored in a secure, encrypted database, and reasonable measures are taken to protect the information from unauthorized access or disclosure.</p>

                <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
                <p>The service retains data related to user interactions and matchmaking outcomes while Piñata Bot is active within a guild (a Discord server). This data facilitates the ongoing functionality of the matchmaking service and enhances user experience by preserving the history of interactions.</p>
                <p>Guild administrators have the authority to delete the entire history of matchmaking records at any time using the /reset command. This action is irreversible and ensures that administrators have control over the data within their guild.</p>
                <p>In the event that Piñata Bot is removed from a guild, all retained data specific to that guild—including previous matchmaking records—will be stored securely for a period of one month. This retention period allows for the possibility of data recovery in the case of accidental bot removal. Upon the conclusion of the one-month period following Piñata Bot's departure from a guild, all related data will be permanently deleted from the database. This measure is in place to ensure user privacy and data protection with the commitment to user data security and compliance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

                <h2>Your Data Rights</h2>
                <p>You have the right to request a copy of your data, to rectify any data, or to request the deletion of your data. Please contact us sing the links below to make such requests.</p>

                <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
                <p>The Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.</p>
